# BMAD or Spec-kit

BMAD and Spec-kit. These are two different tools from the post-vibe coding spectrum. 

If you want to build a product, choose BMAD. It will help you conduct brainstorming sessions using many methods that incredibly broaden your perspective. It will guide you through market research, compare competitors, and much, much more. 

It's true that when you're making a landing page, it's overkill, which is why in such cases, it's worth choosing something lighter, and Spec-kit is great for that.

So, BMAD if you're thinking about building a full product with many decisions to make, how things should work, etc. Spec-kit if you want to go a step further than vibe coding, but don't need a full "team" of agents working with you
